### Art Piece 1

One piece that I appreciate by Maurice Benayoun, also known as MoBen, is “Occupy Wall Screens.” This is a play on the term “Occupy Wall Street” and in this installation, MoBen’s art pieces display in real time the stock valuation readouts of major financial institutions next to emotional currents emanating from Occupy sites, search engines, and social media around the world. This is shown in the pictures.
  
I think this is interesting for a multitude of reasons. The first is the imagery. It uses familiar stock ticker imagery to display both stock prices as well as emotion. I think portraying emotions in this manner is intriguing because it shows the connection between Wall Street and the people protesting against it. It shows that just as the market moves up and down, so do people’s emotions. This shows how feelings associated with movements like Occupy Wall Street are really connected to actions in the market they are protesting against. I also liked this exhibit because I did not realize that it was possible to quantify emotions and portraying it as a percentage was something I had never seen before.

### Art Piece 2

While I do not fully understand how this exhibit works technologically, I found the description of it extremely interesting. It is called Still Moving, The Mechanics of Emotions. It is an interactive piece of artwork and when the artwork is touched, music is produced that only the person touching the exhibit can see. Again, this takes digital data and incorporates it into the artwork because it is a snapshot of the map of world emotions. This takes information from search engines and constantly changes the volume and intensity of music in different places on the map based on emotion, making the map constantly “still moving.” Again, I thought this artistic take on a qualitative subject such as emotions was very interesting and is something that I would have liked to have experienced.
